A)Scala is both a Functional programming and Object Oriented programming language that runs on the JVM! 

In Step 1 of the diagram, as a developer, you will write your Scala code. 
In Step 2 of the diagram, you will call the Java compiler namely javac to compile your Java code. With regards to compiling your Scala code, you would use the Scala compiler namely scalac. 
In most cases, you will be using an Integrated Development Environment or IDE to help you easily write and compile your applications.
In Step 3 of the diagram,  your compiled classes are converted into byte code which is in essence the language that the JVM understands and where your code will eventually be run from. 


B)GetClass
you need not specify the type of a value or variable. It is inferred from the type of the expression with which you initialize it. 
you may occasionally want to print the class/type of an object to understand how Scala works, or to debug code.

When you want to learn about the types Scala is automatically assigning on your behalf, call the getClass method on the object.

scala> def printClass(c: Any) { println(c.getClass) }
printClass: (c: Any)Unit

scala> printClass(1)
class java.lang.Integer

scala> printClass("yo")
class java.lang.String

 C)How do I dynamically instantiate an object and invoke a method using reflection?
 
 




1)How to determine the class of a Scala object (getClass)
